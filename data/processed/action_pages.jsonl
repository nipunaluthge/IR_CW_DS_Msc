We will be undertaking a review \nof our pools to ensure our investment and service \ndelivery meets the needs of the community into \nthe future. \nWe’re continuing to repair and improve essential \ninfrastructure like our stormwater management \nsystems to reduce the risk of flash flooding and \ndrainage in some sports fields, to combat the \nimpact of changing weather patterns which are  \nthe result of climate change.\nWhile we continue to be challenged by the cost \nof building materials, and interrupted supply \nchains for construction materials, we’re focussed \non delivering infrastructure projects like the work \ncurrently underway that will see Beaton Park \nbecome a Regional Tennis Hub with 8 of the 14 \nnew courts constructed to an International Tennis \nFederation standard.\nThe new integrated Community Centre and Library \nfacilities for the city’s southern suburbs and \nfor Helensburgh remain top of the agenda, and \nwe’re building a new waste cell at Whyte’s Gully \nand developing and expanding the landfill gas \nmanagement system at the site.\nThis is the last Delivery Program and Operational \nPlan for this term of Council, and it’s one that \nclearly demonstrates a proactive and community-\nfocussed pathway forward for the organisation.\nI encourage everyone to read it and see what we’re \ndoing for you, your neighbours, your suburb and \nyour community.\nThere is a hardworking and passionate team at \nWollongong City Council and this document is \ntestament to what they do day in and out to make \nWollongong a great place to live, work and play.\nWollongong City Lord Mayor  \nCouncillor Gordon Bradbery AM"}

The community over the past \ntwelve months has provided feedback on our \nservices, facilities and projects. We are committed \nto responding to this feedback. We will continue \nto invest time and resources into improving \ncommunity engagement and customer experience. \nOur community has asked us to continue with our \nfocus on local suburbs. We’ve thoughtfully planned \nwhat we’ll deliver, with a strong focus on delivering \nprojects that will help build communities in our \nsuburbs. \nCouncil continues to maintain a strong financial \nposition, but we’re not immune to the current \neconomic pressures. We acknowledge that \nresidents and businesses are experiencing \nchallenges. We have been mindful and respectful \nof this when preparing our plans. Given the current \nenvironment, we’re being prudent in what we \ncommit to delivering. This equates to ensuring we \ndo everything possible to deliver whatever it is  \nwe say we are planning to deliver. We are focused \non transparency and will report to the community \nmonthly on our financial position and quarterly  \non our progress against these plans.\nThese plans are focused on enhancing and \nsupporting the liveability of our community and \ndelivering the quality services that our community \nwant from their Council. We’re planning over 150 \nroad upgrades across our Local Government Area \nand continuing to invest in footpaths, shared paths, \nand dedicated cycleways to make it safer for kids \nto get to school and more enticing for people of \nall ages and all skill levels to participate in active \nmodes of transport.\nWollongong is a city with incredible natural beauty.  \nThese documents set out our plans to care for our \ncoastline and natural areas through investment in \nconservation and restoration projects, as well as \nintroducing more sustainable waste management \npractices. We’re also focused on the safety of our \ncommunity through natural disasters and investing  \nin upgrades to our stormwater services to reduce  \nthe risk of flooding.\nOn the 6 April 2024, our community experienced a \nsevere weather event, impacting many suburbs and  \nresulting in significant damage to community assets, \nCouncil buildings and critical infrastructure.  \nThis event was declared a natural disaster; the sixth \nnatural disaster for Wollongong since 2019.\nClean-up and repair work resulting from the April  \n2024 natural disaster will impact Council's budget \nmoving forward. This challenging operating  \nenvironment requires significant ongoing  \nfocus and attention.\nCouncil has strong relationships with other levels of \ngovernment and will continue to work closely and \ntactically to advocate for our community with  \nsecuring support and funding towards recovery and \nfuture resilience. \nAs our city’s population grows, we’re investing in \nmajor infrastructure works to improve access to the \nareas around West Dapto, including West Dapto Road \nand Cleveland Road. We’re also ensuring the new \ndevelopments in these areas are well thought out  \nwith footpaths and green spaces to build  \nliveable communities. \nI hope you feel as inspired as I do, reading these \nimportant plans for our future. This Delivery Program \n2022-2026 and Operational Plan 2024- 2025 sets  \nout a clear framework for the future that will build  \nour city’s resilience, continue our financial  \nsustainability and connect our community.\nGreg Doyle \nGeneral Manager\nImage: North Beach, Wollongong  \nPhoto Caitlyn Phanith (Unsplash) "}
